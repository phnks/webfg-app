# Cypress Testing Documentation\n\nThis directory contains the end-to-end Cypress tests for the webfg-gm-app frontend.\n\n## Running Tests Locally\n\nTo run the Cypress tests, you must first ensure the webfg-gm-app application is running locally.\n\n1.  **Start the application:**\n    Navigate to the `webfg-gm-app` directory and run the development server:\n    ```bash\n    cd webfg-gm-app\n    npm start\n    ```\n    *(Note: You may need a `.env.dev` file configured for the app to start. See the main `webfg-gm-app/README.md` for details.)*\n\n2.  **Run Cypress:**\n\n    *   **Interactive Mode (Cypress App):**\n        To open the Cypress test runner GUI, run:\n        ```bash\n        cd webfg-gm-app\n        npx cypress open\n        ```\n        This will launch the Cypress application, where you can select and watch tests run in a browser. *(Note: This requires a graphical environment and may not work in all terminal setups.)*\n\n    *   **Headless Mode (CLI):**\n        To run tests directly from the command line in a headless browser (useful for CI/CD or simple execution), run:\n        ```bash\n        cd webfg-gm-app\n        npx cypress run\n        ```\n        This will execute all tests in the `cypress/e2e` directory and output the results to the terminal.\n\n## Recommended NPM Scripts\n\nFor easier execution, use the NPM scripts added to `webfg-gm-app/package.json`:\n\n-   `npm run cypress:open` - Opens the Cypress test runner.\n-   `npm run cypress:run` - Runs tests headlessly via the CLI.\n\nThese scripts handle navigating to the correct directory and executing the `npx cypress` commands.\n\nEnsure the application is running (`npm start`) before running any Cypress commands.\n
